What is a Node module? 
A node module is, as the checkpoint explains, a set of functions that are importable / `require`-able in other code.

What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?
I didn't even realise these were two different things until this question I went back and realised I did the coding practice / challenge with exports not module exports. The main difference between exports and module exports is that module exports is an object that contains methods.

Why is using exports recommended?
If this question is asking why it is recommended to use `exports` and not why using exports of either kind in general then..:
`exports` is not reassignable outside of the module, meaning you won't risk breaking your code by accidentally setting exports to equal something else.
